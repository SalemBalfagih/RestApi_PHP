# Flutter & REST API (PHP) - User and Notes Management Application

This application uses Flutter for the frontend and a REST API built with PHP for the backend to manage users and their notes. The app allows users to register, log in, add, edit, and delete notes.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Allows users to create an account and log in using a username and password.
- **Add Notes**: Users can add new notes to their account.
- **View Notes**: Displays a list of notes associated with each user.
- **Edit Notes**: Modify existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes from the database.
- **User Authentication**: Protect access to notes using authentication. Only logged-in users can access their own notes.
